Sniff is a simple image loader for Kotlin JVM and it supports the new jetpack compose ui for desktop ðŸ”¥ , inspired from Picasso for android and built on the top of Ktor Client as default. It will support different kinds of caching, the library it self will be easily extendible and re-usable.

## Currently Working On
- Singleton instance of Sniff from factory.
- Optimize in-memory caching.
- Create Disk caching.
- Create factories for each service.
- Add fade option upon rendering.
- Enhance fallbacks and retries of network calls, apply them in the correct way.
- Project modularization.
- Option to apply image color filters in an easy way
- Option to add place holder when loading

## Project Structure

- -> cache: All caching strategies with a single access point
- -> component: Jetpack ui image view component
- -> loader: All types of loaders Online,Offline and both
- -> service: contains HTTPClients to dowload the image (currently KTOR)
- -> sniff: will be the public access point for library users.

## How To use

``` NetworkImage(url = URL,scope = coroutineScope) ```
